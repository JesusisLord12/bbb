  <p>Jeremiah, who not only hid his underwear in a rock but then went back to retrieve it after a “long time” <a href = https://bible.usccb.org/bible/jeremiah/13">(Jeremiah 13).</a> Jeremiah apparently didn’t mind parting with under garments, but he couldn’t be separated from the cattle yoke he had fastened to his shoulders until another prophet broke it off (Jeremiah 27 and 28).</p>
